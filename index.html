          <h1>Kickstarter fulfillment</h1>
          We've worked with several Kickstarters in the zine publishing space to help them get their prints packed and sent out! We handle everything for a fixed price so you can be upfront with your backers. We do the customs declarations too; so you can be sure nothing will be held up!</br><br>

          You just let us know what you're sending, ship it to us and we'll get it sent out. No drama.

          <h1>Dropshipping and reverse logistics</h1>
          As a small company we can be super flexible with what services we offer and we're pleased to support a full complement of inbound and outbound services.<br><br>

          This works well if you need us to store, ship out and then collect on your behalf. Examples include event cases, WFH equipment and stock consolidation & forwarding.<br><br>

          Full inventory management is included, and we'll work through your requirements to give you a fully tailored service.

          <h1>Swag shipping for online events</h1>
          We can help! Retaining that physical connection with attendees is important, and we know how delightful a selection of goodies can be. It can really make the difference! It's also a great way to engage attendees with your sponsors and another option you can add to your sponsor deck. </br><br>

          Ship us your swag, tell us what you want in each swag pack and let us know who we're sending it to. Then you can make a cuppa and move the Trello card over! </br><br>

          <h1>Swag sourcing</h1>

          <dt>Is this environmentally friendly?</dt>

          <dt>Where do you ship from?</dt>
          <dd>Reading, UK.</dd>
