          In short: source, store, pack and distribute a range of swag for online events, devrel and company swag packs. We have experience doing this for a range of events, large and small and we're run by a seasoned hackathon organiser who knows what makes events tick. </br>
          We take the strain of managing your mailout, while you get on with delighting attendees in the way you know best.

          <h1>Swag shipping for events</h1>
          We can help! Retaining that physical connection with attendees is important, and we know how delightful a selection of goodies can be. It can really make the difference! It's also a great way to engage attendees with your sponsors and another option you can add to your sponsor deck. </br>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          You ship us your swag, or arrange for your suppliers and sponsors to ship to us, tell us what you want in each swag pack and let us know who we're sending it to. Then you can make a cuppa and move the Trello card over! </br> 
          We use a variety of carriers and shipping methods to get the best value for your event. 
          <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
          This depends primarily on what you're sending. Costs for just stickers start from &pound;1 per pack. </br>

          <h1>Devrel and swag orders</h1>
          Storing and sending out swag to events and individuals can be tiresome and eat up your time. We can competitively store and distribute your swag to hackathons and individuals alike, giving you that peace of mind that your swag will get there in time.

          <h1>Swag sourcing</h1>
          We work with a number of companies to design and produce whatever swag you can imagine on short deadlines and to your specifications. This works particularly well for companies looking to send out a swag pack to their people - we can handle all the logistics, and work with your designers to make best use of your brand.

          <dt>Is this environmentally friendly?</dt>
