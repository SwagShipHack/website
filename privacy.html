          If you're reading this, it's likely that you've come here from a form where we're asking for some information from you. 
          <br>
          We work with various events and companies who want to send you a small box of goodies - yay! Sometimes they collect your details directly and then pass them on to us. In other cases they will ask us to collect your details directly on their behalf. 
          <br>
          The information we may collect from you is: 
          <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your address</li>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>Your phone number</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          We process this information for the purposes of: 
          <ul>
            <li>Knowing who and where we're sending stuff to!</li>
            <li>Being able to contact you if there is an issue with your address, or your goodies are returned to us :(</li>
            <li>Sending you tracking information for some shipments, via our carriers</li>
            <li>Providing contact information to customs agencies, where requested, so they can arrange release of your package to you</li>
            <li>Invoicing the event/company sending you swag the correct amount</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          We will store your information securely and delete it within 3 months of the date of shipping. We keep it that long so we can get in contact with anyone whose package is returned. 
          <br>
          We pass on your data to our carrier partners so they can deliver your package to you. We currently ship to individuals via Royal Mail, whose privacy policy is available <a href="royalmail.com/privacy">here</a>.
          <br>
          We'll also comply with any legal law enforcement or judicial requests to provide information, as required under UK law. 
          <br>
          If you want to exercise any of your rights under the GDPR, please send us <a href="mailto:hugh@swagshiphack.dev">an email</a>.
